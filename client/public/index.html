This is a proof of concept based on Cheng Lou's
totally amazing React Motion library:
https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion

Really just a proof of concept to see if I could get
it working across multiple columns (i.e. no source order 
reflowing) for a kanban / trello list app I'm working on.

However, I couldn't elegantly solve the issue of variable 
item heights in calculateVisiblePositions(), so have decided 
to drop this as it is and move over to react-dnd instead.

If anyone ever figures out how to do this with variable 
item heights, please let me know!
